	  Enable this driver to get read/write support to 24cl16/32 EEPROMs.

	  If you use this with an SMBus adapter instead of an I2C adapter,
	  full functionality is not available.  Only smaller devices are
	  supported (24c16 and below, max 4 kByte).

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called 24lcx.
